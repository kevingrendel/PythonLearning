The comets that are approaching the Sun lose their composition every time they orbit as their ice melts and forms its tail. The 3200 Phaethon though, shows minor activity as it approaches the Sun, making some scientists believe that the asteroid is actually an inactive comet nucleus, although it mostly acts as an asteroid. It is going to approach our planet in December, making it the closest to our planet since 1974, and until after 2093. However, scientists will observe the asteroid and try to find out whether it is actually the suspected comet nucleus.
